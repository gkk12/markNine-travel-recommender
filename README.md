This is an application to recommend a travel place for visit in Europe. At first, a user can select any of the 3 cities: 
1. Heidelberg (Germany)
2. Stuttgart (Germany) 
3. Switzerland 
Further, the list of popular(also my favorite) attractions in the selected city will be shown as a list. The recommended places in the first city are shown on page load as default.
